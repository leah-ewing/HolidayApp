            Hi there! I'm Leah Ewing, a junior full-stack engineer and the sole developer behind HolidayHub. Fueled by a passion for coding and celebrations, I ventured into creating HolidayHub, a platform born out of my love for crafting delightful experiences.

            HolidayHub is your ultimate calendar app, revealing the unique holiday being celebrated on any given day. Utilizing Flask for the backend and HTML/CSS for the frontend, I've meticulously crafted this platform. The robustness of our database, powered by PostgreSQL and SQLAlchemy, ensures seamless management of celebrations and user experiences. If you sign up, HolidayHub will send you daily emails, keeping you updated on the day's special holiday. Leveraging AI technology, for holiday blurbs and daily emails (even this "About Me" page!), allows me to ensure that every aspect of your experience is professionally written and engaging; because, speaking for writing, well, let's just say "thank goodness" for AI, swooping in to save the day when my writing skills could use a debugging session!
